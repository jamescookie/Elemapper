===================================================================
Version 1.8 - Nov 2011

Dusted off after such a long time!
Fixed exits not deleting (why did I never spot this before?)
Made Intellij generate the jar file

===================================================================
Version 1.7
===================================================================

Added guards.
Had to include all of xerces.jar as the dependancies were not correctly identified.
Re-included the DTD so old files are still loadable - This will be removed at some point.
Updated to Java 1.5.
Updated to JDom 1.0.

===================================================================
Version 1.6
===================================================================

Update the exit's tab with more information (eg concealed).
Updated the code generated to use DOOR_CHANGE rather than a seperate look function.
Changed the update method as the powerupdate license had expired.
Changed Vectors to ArrayLists for speed.
Added support for functions - This will enable guards to be added.
Removed dependancy on DTD - It was getting hard to make it backwards compatiable.
Updated to Java 1.4.

Stopped the current room tab from changing when selecting another room.

Removed empty functions tab (more to come on this).
Fix a bug from Torallion where the default sounds/smells were polluting other rooms.

===================================================================

Updated so that a empty long description can still be uploaded and work.
You can now overwrite a room when copy and pasting which allows you to create room templates.
